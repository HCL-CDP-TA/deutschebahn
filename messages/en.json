          "question": "What is a BahnCard?",
          "answer": "A BahnCard is a discount card issued by Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railway company. It offers various levels of discounts on train tickets for a period of one year. BahnCards are available in three main types: BahnCard 25 (25% discount), BahnCard 50 (50% discount), and BahnCard 100 (100% discount, essentially a flat-rate ticket)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long is my BahnCard valid for?",
          "answer": "A standard BahnCard is valid for one year from the date of purchase. Trial BahnCards are valid for three months. Your BahnCard will automatically renew for another year unless you cancel it at least 6 weeks before the expiration date. The exact expiration date is printed on your BahnCard."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use my BahnCard for international train journeys?",
          "answer": "Yes, your BahnCard can be used for international journeys that originate in Germany. The discount applies to the German part of the journey. Additionally, many European railway partners offer discounts to BahnCard holders, such as Ã–BB in Austria, SBB in Switzerland, and SNCF in France."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between 1st and 2nd class BahnCards?",
          "answer": "A 1st class BahnCard entitles you to discounts on 1st class tickets, while a 2nd class BahnCard provides discounts on 2nd class tickets. 1st class offers more spacious seating, additional services, and quieter compartments. BahnCard 50 and BahnCard 100 for 1st class also include additional benefits like lounge access and City-Ticket for local public transport."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I cancel my BahnCard?",
          "answer": "You can cancel your BahnCard by submitting a cancellation request at least 6 weeks before the expiration date. Cancellation can be done online through your customer account, by phone via the customer service center, in person at a DB travel center, or in writing by mail to the Deutsche Bahn customer service address provided with your BahnCard."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I upgrade my BahnCard?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade your BahnCard at any time. For example, you can upgrade from a BahnCard 25 to a BahnCard 50 or from 2nd class to 1st class. The price difference will be calculated proportionally based on the remaining validity period of your current BahnCard. Contact DB customer service or visit a DB travel center to request an upgrade."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do children need their own BahnCard?",
          "answer": "Children under 6 years travel for free without a ticket or BahnCard when accompanied by an adult. Children aged 6-14 can have their own BahnCard at reduced rates, or they can travel for free when accompanied by parents or grandparents who own a BahnCard, as long as they are listed on the adult's BahnCard family supplement."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I lose my BahnCard?",
          "answer": "If you lose your BahnCard, you should report it immediately to DB customer service. A replacement card can be issued for a fee (usually around â‚¬15). If you have the digital BahnCard in the DB Navigator app, you can continue to use it while waiting for your physical replacement card."
